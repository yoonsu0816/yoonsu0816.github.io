## About Me

Hello👋!  My name is Yoonsu Kim, and I am a Ph.D. student of [School of Computing](http://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/).  
I am working with [Prof. Juho Kim](https://juhokim.com/) at [KIXLAB (KAIST Interaction Lab)](https://www.kixlab.org/), and I graduated from [KAIST AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) with a Master's Degree.

My research interests include around **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Human-Centered AI**, and **Human-AI collaboration**.

I am particularly interested in **👀 understanding the difficulties users face when interacting with AI systems**, **🤖 designing AI systems that enhance human capabilities from a Human-Centered perspective**, and **🧑‍💻 enabling people to effectively use and collaborate with AI to amplify their abilities**.  

Recently, I have been particularly interested in developing user-centered interactions that support **intent alignment in generative AI systems**, such as large language models (LLMs). 
Through my work, I aim to contribute to helping people better utilize new technology 🌏❤️.
